Short answer: I'm Andrew. I like to code. I like to learn from people. I look for experiences that humble me. And every now and then, I would try out a new sport. I created this blog to share some of my life experiences. I don't think I have a particularly interesting life, but it seems like it could be worth sharing. 

Long answer: I'm currently a college student, precisely a junior, studying CS at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. English is my second lanuage, and I think it's nessecary to continously learn new langauges. It's difinitely a priviledge. It's a proccess that shouldn't stop untill you become succesful. Has it occured to you yet? *The typos may or may not have been intented.*

In terms of professional experience, I have worked at [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) for a summer as Software Engineer Intern. I have built a few personal projects, some of which were out of curiousity and some were out of necessity. My biggest one yet is an all-in-one event management web platform for activism. Take a look at it here: [chants.live](https://chants.live/). It's still in beta. 

I'm a self-taught web and Android developer. I do both backend and frontend. I'm obsessed with anything that has "systems" or "architecture" in it. I am currently open to collaborating on projects.
